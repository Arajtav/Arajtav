## Hi
I\`m Ar√§jtav and I make music (and code sometimes).  

## Languages and whatever
I probably know more stuff than I listed here.
- c
- go
- python
- js/css/html
- tailwind
- php
- next js
- sql

## Other stuff
- It's not like I\`m not active, just most repos I have are private.
- I think that 4 spaces are better than tab.
- I like glitched sounds and images.

## Some stats
